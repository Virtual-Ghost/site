We begin with zero as one, the singularity of nothing. What is the mystery of such an initiation, the sacrifical rites that establish and begin worlds, that _makes sense_? From the point of view from within a system, sense is a ghost that haunts over it while simultaneously forming its foundation, the initial transgression from which all new things follow. This has been known since Duns Scotus as the _principle of explosion_ whereby the miracle of a concrete contradiction flows out the continious generation of the new.
